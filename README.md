## Description
  
The purpose of my app is to: Create a blog application that allows users to create an account and create blog posts documenting their software engineering journey, tips, etc., make edits to their posts, delete their posts, and to comment on other users posts sharing their feelings.
  
The app is intended for: Users who would like to share/document their software enegineering experiences, users who want to get into software engineering but need a place to start, or users that are looking for things to learn/read about software engineering.
  
The reason I created the app is: Provide a platform for users who are in software engineering, want to get into it and learn, and provide an alternative to other websites.
  
Some victories I experienced include: Connecting the front end with the back end.
  
Some challenges I experienced include: Figuring out the routing for different pages.

## Installation

  Users will need to install the following:
  
    * "bcrypt": "^5.0.0",
    * "connect-session-sequelize": "^7.0.4",
    * "dotenv": "^8.2.0",
    * "exphbs": "^1.2.0",
    * "express": "^4.17.1",
    * "express-handlebars": "^5.2.0",
    * "express-session": "^1.17.1",
    * "mysql2": "^2.2.5",
    * "sequelize": "^6.3.5"

## Usage

  There are a couple methods to installing the npms. The first method is to do an npm install/i for each of the package one at a time, and to include the @ with the version they would like to install (i.e. npm i bcrypt@5.0.0). The second method is to create a package.json file, copy and pasting the following text:

    "dependencies": {
    "bcrypt": "^5.0.0",
    "connect-session-sequelize": "^7.0.4",
    "dotenv": "^8.2.0",
    "exphbs": "^1.2.0",
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "express-handlebars": "^5.2.0",
    "express-session": "^1.17.1",
    "mysql2": "^2.2.5",
    "sequelize": "^6.3.5"
    }

  Once that has been copy and pasted, user would have to create a server.js file, open the server.js file in the integrated terminal (right-click the server.js file, then select open in an integrated terminal), and lastly run npm i to install all the packages at once. Once user has installed all the packages successfully, they will have access to all of the packages.
